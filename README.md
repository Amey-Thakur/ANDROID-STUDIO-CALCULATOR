<!-- OVERVIEW -->
<a name="overview"></a>
## Overview

**Android Studio Calculator** is a precision-engineered mobile utility developed using **Java** and **Android Studio**, focusing on logical state management and UI symmetry. By leveraging the **Android Activity Lifecycle**, this project offers a stable, responsive, and mathematically accurate platform for basic arithmetic, bridging the gap between functional utility and scholarly software documentation.

### core mechanics
The application is governed by strict **computational design patterns** ensuring fidelity and responsiveness:
*   **Logical Precedence**: The engine utilizes a synchronous arithmetic pipeline, ensuring that every input event is processed in real-time with zero-latency state transitions.
*   **UI Symmetry**: Unlike generic utilities, the interface integrates a **ConstraintLayout-based geometry** that dynamically adapts to diverse mobile screen ratios, preserving visual balance.
*   **State Persistence**: Input handling is synchronized with the Android lifecycle, ensuring that the calculation corridor remains stable during orientation changes or system interruptions.

> [!TIP]
> **Sensory Feedback Integration**
>
> To maximize input clarity, the application employs a **Tactile Feedback System**. **Haptic triggers** synchronize with touch events, and **dynamic text scaling** visualizes the expression's complexity, strictly coupling user intent with system response. This ensures the user's mental model is constantly synchronized with the underlying arithmetic simulation without reliance on intrusive HUD elements.

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Arithmetic Engine** | Core logic for Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division with real-time evaluation. |
| **Responsive UI** | Optimized XML-based layouts using **ConstraintLayout** for multi-device compatibility. |
| **Memory Efficiency** | Minimalized runtime footprint ensuring performance on legacy Android hardware. |
| **Lifecycle Integration** | Robust state persistence synchronized with the **Android Activity Lifecycle**. |
| **Tactile Feedback** | Integrated haptic response for enhanced user interaction and input confirmation. |
| **Input Sanitization** | Heuristic-based input validation to prevent logical calculation errors. |
| **Academic Clarity** | In-depth and detailed comments integrated throughout the codebase for transparent logic study. |
| **Social Persistence** | **Interactive Footer Integration** bridging the tool to the source repository. |

> [!NOTE]
> ### Interactive Polish: The Logical Singularity
> We have engineered a **Logic-Driven State Manager** that calibrates arithmetic scores across multiple vectors to simulate high-precision calculation transfer. The visual language focuses on the minimalist "Material Digital" aesthetic, ensuring maximum focus on the interactive numerical trajectory.

### Tech Stack
- **Languages**: Java (JDK 11+)
- **Logic**: **Android Activity Lifecycle** (State Management & Arithmetic Logic)
- **Geometry**: **ConstraintLayout** (Responsive XML Layouts)
- **UI System**: Premium Material Design (Custom Android Views)

<!-- QUICK START -->
<a name="quick-start"></a>
## Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites
- **Android Studio**: Required for building and development. [Download Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
- **Git**: For version control and cloning. [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

> [!WARNING]
> **APK Execution Security**
>
> When installing the pre-compiled `Calculator.apk` on a physical Android device, you may encounter a **"Blocked by Play Protect"** or **"Unknown Apps"** warning. This is expected for scholarship-based, self-signed APKs. To proceed with the installation, select "Install anyway" or enable "Allow from this source" in your device's security settings.

### 2. Installation & Setup

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Open your terminal and clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Amey-Thakur/ANDROID-STUDIO-CALCULATOR.git
cd ANDROID-STUDIO-CALCULATOR
```

#### Step 2: Open in Android Studio
